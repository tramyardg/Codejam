            <h1>Coding challenges</h1>
            <h3>Reverse add challenge</h3>
            <p>
                The problem is as follows: choose a number, <br/>
                reverse its digits and add it to the original. 

                If the sum is not a palindrome (which means, <br/>
                it is not the same number from left to right and right to left), repeat this procedure.
            </p>

            <b>For example:</b><br/>

            195 (initial number) + 591 (reverse of initial number) = 786<br/>

            786 + 687 = 1473<br/>

            1473 + 3741 = 5214<br/>

            5214 + 4125 = 9339 (palindrome)<br/>
            <p>
                In this particular case the palindrome 9339 appeared after the 4th addition. <br/>
                This method leads to palindromes in a few step for almost all of the integers. <br/>
                But there are interesting exceptions. <br/>
                196 is the first number for which no palindrome has been found. <br/>
                It is not proven though, that there is no such a palindrome.
            </p>
            <b>Input sample:</b>
            <p>
                Your program should accept as its first argument a path to a filename. <br/>
                Each line in this file is one test case. <br/>
                Each test case will contain an integer n is less than 10,000. <br/>
                Assume each test case will always have an answer and <br/>
                that it is computable with less than 100 iterations (additions).<br/>
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Output sample:</b>
            <p>
                For each line of input, generate a line of output which is the <br/>
                number of iterations (additions) to compute the palindrome and <br/>
                the resulting palindrome. (they should be on one line and separated <br/>
                by a single space character).
            </p>
