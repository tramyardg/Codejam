                <h2>Challenge Description:</h2>

                <p>Credits: Programming Challenges by Steven S. Skiena and Miguel A. Revilla</p>
                <p>
                    You will be given the x/y co-ordinates of several locations. <br>
                    You will be laying out 1 cable between two of these locations.<br> 
                    In order to minimise the cost, your task is to find the shortest distance <br>
                    between a pair of locations, so that pair can be chosen for the cable installation.<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Your program should accept as its first argument a path to a filename. <br>
                    The input file contains several sets of input. Each set of input starts<br> 
                    with an integer N (0<=N<=10000), which denotes the number of points in this set. <br>
                    The next N line contains the coordinates of N two-dimensional points. <br>
                    The first of the two numbers denotes the X-coordinate and the <br>
                    latter denotes the Y-coordinate. The input is terminated by a set whose N=0. <br>
                    This set should not be processed. <br>
                    The value of the coordinates will be less than 40000 and non-negative. eg.<br>                 
                </p>

                <b>Input sample:</b>
                <p>
                    5<br>
                    0 2<br>
                    6 67<br>
                    43 71<br>
                    39 107<br>
                    189 140<br>
                    0<br>
                </p>                

                <b>Output sample:</b>
                <p>
                    For each set of input produce a single line of output containing a floating <br>
                    point number (with four digits after the decimal point) which denotes the distance <br>
                    between the closest two points. If there is no such two points in the input <br>
                    whose distance is less than 10000, print the line INFINITY. eg. 
                </p>
